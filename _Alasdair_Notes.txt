TODO:
edit cuda_seq to run only cpu parts (in lieu of gpu access), 
maybe this is more update/functional (read: works past clusterization)

plot local clusters: write cluster info out into csv then process in pyplot

for visualising spacepoints try data of 'single muon sample' rather than something saturated 
which would give a big, indiscernible splodge 
- look into toy detector n particles c.f. readme 
(n is 2000 in readme, is there a version with smaller n?)
